Titanic_ML_Project
This project is a machine learning exercise focused on predicting passenger survival from the Titanic disaster. It uses the Titanic dataset and applies a basic classification model to forecast survival outcomes based on features like passenger class, gender, age, and fare.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

üß© Project Structure Data Loading: Read Titanic dataset (titanic.csv) into a pandas DataFrame.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand data distribution, visualize survival patterns, and check missing values.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and drop irrelevant columns.

Model Building: Train a Logistic Regression model to predict survival.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.

Conclusion: Summarize findings and suggest potential improvements.

üöÄ How to Run Open the Jupyter Notebook (titanic_ml_assignment.ipynb).

Run all cells sequentially to:

Load and explore the data

Preprocess the data

Train and evaluate the machine learning model

Review outputs like graphs, confusion matrix, and final metrics.

üìà Key Results The Logistic Regression model achieved approximately [Insert Accuracy]% accuracy on the test set.

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were balanced, indicating a reliable classification performance.

Visualization of the confusion matrix and ROC curve helped analyze model strengths and weaknesses.

üì¢ Conclusion The Titanic Survival Prediction project demonstrates a complete workflow from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. Future improvements could include trying other models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) or tuning hyperparameters for even better accuracy.

This project was completed as part of a machine learning assignment focusing on applying fundamental ML concepts to real-world datasets.
